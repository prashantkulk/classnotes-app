<h1>ClassNotes - Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 21, 2025</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>ClassNotes ("we", "our", or "the app") is a mobile application that helps parents and teachers share class notes within school groups. We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data responsibly.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>Information you provide:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Phone number:</strong> Used for account creation and sign-in via Firebase Authentication. We do not use your phone number for marketing or share it with third parties.</li>
    <li><strong>Display name:</strong> A name you choose (e.g., "Aditi's Mom") shown to other group members.</li>
    <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Photos of class notes that you choose to upload and share with your group.</li>
    <li><strong>Group information:</strong> Group names, school names, and membership information.</li>
    <li><strong>Messages:</strong> Comments on shared notes and note request descriptions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Information collected automatically:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Device token:</strong> A Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) token for sending push notifications. This token does not identify you personally.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
    <li>To authenticate your account and provide the app service</li>
    <li>To display your shared notes to members of your groups</li>
    <li>To send push notifications when notes you requested are shared</li>
    <li>To display your name alongside notes you share and requests you make</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
<ul>
    <li>All data is stored in Google Firebase (Firestore, Firebase Storage, Firebase Authentication), hosted in secure Google Cloud data centers.</li>
    <li>Photos are stored in Firebase Storage and are accessible only via secure download URLs.</li>
    <li>Data is transmitted over HTTPS/TLS encryption.</li>
    <li>We do not store passwords — authentication is handled entirely by Firebase Phone Auth using one-time verification codes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Your shared notes (photos, subject, date, description) are visible to all members of the group you share them in.</li>
    <li>Your display name is visible to other group members.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use any third-party analytics or advertising SDKs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Your account data is retained as long as your account exists.</li>
    <li>Shared notes remain visible to group members even after you leave a group.</li>
    <li>You can delete your account at any time from Settings, which removes your user profile and authentication data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>ClassNotes is designed for use by parents and teachers (adults). The app does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The app is used to share photographs of school notebooks and homework — it does not collect any information directly from students.</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can view all your shared data within the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete your account from Settings > Delete Account, which removes your user profile from our systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Data portability:</strong> Your shared photos can be saved to your device from the photo viewer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> For phone number sign-in (<a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Firebase Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Firestore:</strong> For data storage</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Storage:</strong> For photo storage</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Cloud Messaging:</strong> For push notifications</li>
</ul>
<p>All Firebase services are governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.</p>
